### 7 Testing Principles
========================================================================================================
| Testing is context dependent      |                                                                  |
| Exhaustive testing is impossible  | Perfect testing does not exist                                   |
| Defect clustering                 |                                                                  |
| Early testing is always preferred | Test as early as possible                                        |
| Pesticide paradox                 | When we repeat the same tests, they become ineffective over time |
| Testing shows presence of defects | - Testing can show us that there are problems
|                                   | - CANNOT say that there are no bugs
| Absence-of-errors fallacy         |
