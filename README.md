### 7 Testing Principles
======================================================================================================== <br>
| Testing is context dependent      |                                                                  | <br>
| Exhaustive testing is impossible  | Perfect testing does not exist                                   | <br>
| Defect clustering                 |                                                                  | <br>
| Early testing is always preferred | Test as early as possible                                        | <br>
| Pesticide paradox                 | When we repeat the same tests, they become ineffective over time | <br>
| Testing shows presence of defects | - Testing can show us that there are problems                    | <br>
|                                   | - CANNOT say that there are no bugs                              | <br>
| Absence-of-errors fallacy         |                                                                  | <br>
